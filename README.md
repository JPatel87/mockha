# Mockha

Mockha is a site targeting consumers who are willing to explore vegan cake and coffee. The goal of the site is to promote a vegan bakery where customers can socialise over coffee and cake. The site allows visitors to view the menu to see what is on offer and then make a reservation if they wish to do so.

### Colour palette
* There are four main colours used throughout this website and the inspiration behind these came from the website, [canva](https://www.canva.com/colors/color-palette-generator/). The colour palette is called 
afternoon craving and it consists of four colours, namely Brown (#523a28) Peach (#f8c175), Kelly Green (#73952e) and Khaki (#ccb99f).


* In the body of the text, where a slightly transparent shade of one of the colour palette colours was required, the website [coding.tools](https://coding.tools/hex-to-rgba) was used to provide a RGBA colour alternative.
