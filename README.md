# Mockha

Mockha is a site targeting consumers who are willing to explore vegan cake and coffee. The goal of the site is to promote a vegan bakery where customers can socialise over coffee and cake. The site allows visitors to view the menu to see what is on offer and then make a reservation if they wish to do so.
